        <h2>Common Health Issues</h2>
        <p>In Malaysia, the previous mortality burden has been a significant concern, particularly due to the high prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) as the leading cause of death. Estimates of mortality are key indicators for monitoring population health and determining priorities in health policies and health planning. The aim of this study was to estimate the disease burden attributed to 113 major diseases and injuries in Malaysia in 2018 using years of life lost (YLL) method.</p>

	<p>This study included all deaths that occurred in Malaysia in 2018. The YLL was derived by adding the number of deaths from 113 specific diseases and multiplying it by the remaining life expectancy for that age and sex group. Data on life expectancy and mortality were collected from the Department of Statistics Malaysia.</p>

	<p>In 2018, there were 3.5 million YLL in Malaysia. Group II (NCDs) caused 72.2% of total YLL. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of premature mortality among Malaysians (17.7%), followed by lower respiratory infections (9.7%), road traffic injuries (8.7%), cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (8.0%), and diabetes mellitus (3.9%).</p>

	<p>NCDs are a significant health concern in Malaysia and are the primary contributor to the overall burden of disease. These results are important in guiding the national health systems on how to design and implement effective interventions for NCDs, as well as how to prioritise and allocate healthcare resources. Key strategies to consider include implementing health promotion campaigns, adopting integrated care models, and implementing policy and regulatory measures. These approaches aim to enhance health outcomes and the managements of NCDs in Malaysia</p>
